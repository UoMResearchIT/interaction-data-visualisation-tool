# OBM Data Visualisation Tool


## Introduction

Interaction data is messy (how?), messy(how?), complicated (how?) and difficult to work with.

- big, lots of it
- difficult to read
- machine readable, not human readable?

However, interaction data has the potential to be a great resource in identifying audience behaviour (ref Measuring Behaviours paper?, see other refs used to see if applicable).

I've created a tool that provides a way to create abstractions and visualisations of the data to inform a feature selection process that can tease out audience behaviours.  

## What Does The Tool Do?

Reads Data

Creates Plots 2 based on click data, and three histograms

Statistical data

## What Can Be Gained from this Tool?

Insight into which features are important,

clicks - colour coding
density - see when most of the clicks are happening

histograms - can see patterns of time, clicks, clicks per minute. Why are these important?

## Applications?

Speed up initial analysis and features to look out for.


## Limitations

Large Data Sets = takes longer to get the data needed for plots, lots of statistical noise.
