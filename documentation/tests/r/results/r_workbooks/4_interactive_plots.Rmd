### Introduction

With direction from David I have created an interactive plot using the Shiny package. From the original I have iterated it to server different purposes.

To run the interactive plots locally you will need to run them within R Studio. They can be set up on a Shiny server which I imagine will be the next step.


### shiny_bbc_data_interactive

The interactive plot allows the user to pick the condition of the experiment they want along with, actions, and time period. I kept the play, pause, rewind from the static plots. These can be changed easily to include different types of actions. It is up to us to decide which one's will be th emost interesting to look at.

### shiny_bbc_data_interactive_items

This version of the app calls a modified function that accepst an item, rather than a action. For now it shows the the tabs for the differnet recipes. This again can be adpated for any number of items. 

### shiny_bbc_data_facet_wrap

Instead of switching between the different experiment conditions, they are now all displayed at once on four seperate plots. The downside is that the individual users are differnet across each condition which means that ALL participants ar eon each y-axis. Despite this it is at least a way of seeing differences at a glance across the conditions.

Currently only filtering actions, can be modified to items if need be.

Additionally, conditions are labelled by condition number, noit the more descriptive CAKE Single, Multiple etc.

### To-do

- We need to decide which actions, and items we want to explore. 
- Give these actions and items colours
- Figure out a better way of looking at all the condition types. (ie better facet wrap)
