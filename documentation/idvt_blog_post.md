[CAKE](https://www.bbc.co.uk/taster/pilots/cook-along-kitchen-experience) 
(Cook-Along Kitchen Experience) is an online based interactive experience. 
An OBM (Object Based Media) experience from the BBC. OBM is a way to tailor 
content to the individual users based on their requirements. For example a 
TV broadcast could be broken down into various objects such as audio, 
video, subtitles, then rearranged based on the device that a viewer is 
viewing this content, whether on TV, mobile or in a browser.

In the case of CAKE, at the beginning of the experience users are asked 
several questions such as confidence cooking, number of people cooking for, 
and then tailors the experience based on the user's answers. The experience 
also scaled depending on the device the user was using.

The BBC wanted to find out how people navigate their way through this 
experience. To do this different types of interaction data was collected 
that could give us help us answer that question. Research has shown that 
low level interaction data such as button clicks are an indicator of 
interaction behaviour.

I created a data visualisation tool called Interaction Data Visualisation 
Tool (IDVT) that could take data and make it easier to understand. It takes 
the data, sorts it into a readable format, and creates several different 
visualisations.
